# Welcome to Open States' Github

[Open States](https://openstates.org) strives to improve civic engagement at the state level by providing data and tools regarding state legislatures. 
We aim to serve members of the public, activist groups, journalists, and researchers with better data on what is happening in their state capital, and to provide tools to reduce barriers to participation and increase engagement.

Open States aggregates legislative information from all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. 
This information is then standardized, cleaned, and published to the public via OpenStates.org, a powerful API, and bulk downloads. 
OpenStates.org enables individuals to find out who represents them, look up information on an important bill thatâ€™s been in the news, discover how their representatives are voting, or just stay current with what is happening in their state. 
Additionally, our [API](https://openstates.org/api/) and [bulk downloads](https://openstates.org/data/) see millions of hits every month from advocacy organizations, journalists, researchers, and many others.

As of 2021, Open States is a project of [Civic Eagle](https://www.civiceagle.com/).
